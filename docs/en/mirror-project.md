# Mirrored CAM project — trial

[Русский](../mirror-project.md) | **English**

Script: [`NX_Mirror_Project.py`](../../scripts/NX_Mirror_Project.py). Version: **V1.07**.

## Latest release

**V1.07 · 2026-11-14** — revise MCS/RCS transfer and verification. Follow actual parameter providers through `UF_PARAM_ask_param_definer`, including definitions outside the initial geometry-tree traversal. Local definitions and NX defaults receive explicit reflected bindings only in the copy; inherited nodes are not overwritten.

After update, verify actual origin, axes, inheritance status and provider. A different CSYS tag is accepted only when coordinates and expected inheritance match. Preserve the RCS-to-MCS link flag when present in the required-parameter list. On failure, report the node name, MCS or RCS, original/created/actual systems, statuses, provider and expected/actual coordinates. The stage label no longer remains on the previously read CAM boundary. Cyclic or unresolved providers stop the trial before reflection.

After failure and successful Undo, restore the source as work and displayed part. Report any restoration failure separately from Undo. A successful mirrored copy stays active. Existing copies are neither deleted nor closed automatically. Repeated `_MIRROR_TEST_...` filename suffixes collapse to one; names of parts still open in NX remain reserved even if their disk files were deleted.

**This remains a trial. A complete successful run in NX / Designcenter 2606 is not yet confirmed. Other numerical directions and coordinates inside operation settings are not transformed yet.**

## Workflow

1. Open a simple test part without components. It must be fully loaded, be both work and displayed part, and have a normal `.prt` file on disk.
2. Save it with the normal NX command. The journal stops if the source has unsaved changes; it does not save the source itself.
3. Use **Tools → Journal → Play** to run the script. Updater entry: **«Зеркальная копия CAM-проекта — тест» V1.07**.
4. In the geometry picker, click one **planar face** or **datum plane**, then click **OK**. No name or coordinate entry is required. Oblique planes are supported. The surface defines the plane, not the cursor position; reversing its normal does not change the reflection. Curved surfaces and objects from another component are rejected. Cancelling selection exits without creating a copy.
5. After selecting the plane, the first unused sibling filename such as `name_MIRROR_TEST_001.prt` is created. Existing files and names of parts still open in NX are not reused. To retest the original model, activate it first: the journal copies the work part at launch, even if that is a previous test copy. Collapsing the suffix changes only the output name, not the source data.
6. Read and share the report using **«Копировать всё» (Copy all)**. If checks pass, inspect bodies, MCS frames and the geometry of every operation. Then save the open test copy using the normal NX command and regenerate operations.

**Until manually saved, the reflected result exists only in the open NX session. The file on disk remains the initial copy of the source PRT.**

## Behavior

- Copies the saved PRT byte for byte, verifies checksums and opens a separate part. Source CAM data is not processed.
- Reads operations, MCS/RCS and Part, Blank, Check, Trim, Cut Area, Wall and Drive geometry references in the copy, including collector members and supported boundaries.
- Reflects bodies and supported referenced geometry through a model-parent transformation. Body, face and edge identifiers must remain stable; otherwise the trial fails.
- Creates transferred MCS/RCS frames. X and Z are reflected; Y is reconstructed to form a right-handed coordinate system. Local definitions and NX defaults receive explicit reflected bindings. Resolve inheritance providers through UF; do not overwrite inherited nodes. Verify coordinates, parameter status/provider and the available RCS-to-MCS link flag.
- Transfers user-defined boundary planes without recreating contours. Plane X/Y axes are reflected and Z is reconstructed as the negative of that plane's reflected original Z. MCS Z is transferred separately. The geometric plane and material side should follow the reflection. Parameters and references are checked after update. The copy's WCS is restored to its original position.
- Removes calculated toolpaths in the copy. Does not create mirrored CAM operations, generate paths or postprocess.
- Checks exact oriented object bounds in the selected-plane frame, geometry identifiers, available selected CAM references, operation membership and geometry parents, missing toolpaths and transferred MCS/RCS frames. Finally checks the source file checksum and modification flag.
- On an exception after the Undo mark is created, attempts to undo changes in the copy and reports the stage, error and rollback outcome. After successful rollback, restore the source as work and displayed part. If rollback fails, leave the copy active and ask the user to close it without saving. Restoring the source does not delete files or close other parts.

## First-trial limits

- Only operation classes `VolumeBased25DMillingOperation`, `SurfaceContour`, `PlanarMilling` and `TpMultiAxisDeburring` are accepted. Existing mirrored operations are rejected.
- Supported simple local feature history: DATUM_CSYS, DATUM_PLANE, DATUM_AXIS, SKETCH, EXTRUDE, BLEND, Tooling Box, FSET, BREP, BLOCK, CYLINDER, CONE, SPHERE, IMPORTED_BODY, IMPORT. Other types and detected external parents stop the trial before transformation.
- Components, non-associative boundaries without geometry references and detected custom start/predrill points are not supported yet.
- Other numerical spatial operation parameters are not reflected. The report lists detected local nonzero 3D parameters for inspection; this is not a complete inventory of spatial settings. The journal does not edit feeds, allowances or strategies.
- Preserving references and bounds does not prove machining correctness. Selected regions, directions, engage/retract moves and regenerated paths must be checked before use on production projects.
- Requires Windows and the installed NX UF libraries. Geometry channels unavailable with code 1345005 are listed as unverified. Their contents are not confirmed; successful checks on available references do not establish full coverage of all regions. Other API errors or a failed transformation stop the trial.

## Files and validation

Only the requested PRT copy is created. The journal writes no reports, INI files, logs, archives, temporary files or `.dlx` resources. It does not call Save, SaveAs or SaveAll. The report is held in memory and includes names, coordinates and the copy path. Nothing is sent automatically. A newly created PRT copy may remain on disk after a failed trial.

Sixty-nine checks passed outside NX, including 25 with a separately compiled C library. New coverage includes providers outside the initial traversal, NX defaults, inheritance and RCS/MCS link preservation, equivalent CSYS objects with different tags, rejection of incorrect coordinates/providers, short copy filenames and restoring the source after Undo. The V1.06 report completed reflection and available-geometry checks, then failed the MCS/RCS tag comparison; that report does not include the failing node's actual coordinates or status. A complete V1.07 run still requires validation in NX.
